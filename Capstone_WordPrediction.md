Project Goal
========================================================

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey, a corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models which will be the goal of this project

The “Word Prediction” application is the answer to the problem.

The features that ara available to this application are:

- The application processes the prediction when the user presses the submit button after typing the words

1) When the application loads fill in the words for which you need a prediction

2) Press the submit button or enter
